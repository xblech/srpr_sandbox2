Westbrook proved that he could be an elite PG in the NBA and with the loss of Kevin Durant was given a much larger contract. He has the largest predicted salary according to our model due to his impressive numbers across the board.","According to the model, James is overpaid because he signed a new 3 year, $100 million over the offseason to make more money with the increased salary cap. \"King James\" now has the largest single season salary in NBA history and deserves it due to his winning mentality after leading the Cavs to their first NBA title.","According to the model, Harden is overpaid because, like Westbrook, he renegotiated his contract to make more money with the increased cap. Harden's new role as a PG for the Rockets led him to be paid more money as well.","According to the model, Gasol is underpaid because he signed only a 2 year, $31 million with the Spurs this offseason. The aging star has lost his athleticism and has become injury prone, but our model predicts him to have a larger salary because of his impressive foul shooting, solid rebounding, and amazing passing for a center.","According to the model, Curry is underpaid because he signed his deal for a smaller salary in 2012 when the cap was only $58 million. The two-time reigning MVP should obviously be paid more according to our model because of his outstanding scoring and passing.","According to the model, Wade is overpaid because he signed a 2 year, $47 million deal with the Bulls this offseason. He is the highest ranked SG in terms of predicted salary as he has steadily produced throughout his career.","According to the model, Melo is overpaid as he signed a large contract extension in 2014 when the cap started to increase. The aging star has not necessarily lived up to his name in New York with average rebounding and below average assist numbers.","According to the model, Millsap is overpaid because he signed a big deal in 2015. Millsap was a bit of a surprise to see this high on the rankings, but like Wade, he has had a steady career that has blossomed over the last two years with the Hawks.","According to the model, Cousins is overpaid because of his 2013 re-negotiation although he has put up phenomenal numbers in rebounds and points in every season he has played in the NBA. ","According to the model, Aldridge is overpaid because he signed a 4 year, $84,100,000 deal in 2015 to go to the Spurs. He still has put up great rebounding and scoring numbers, but they have gone down a bit since joining the Spurs where his minutes have also gone down.","According to the model, Dirk is overpaid because he recently signed a 2 year, $50 million deal this summer. Dirk has had a fantastic career with plenty of points which is why it is no surprise to see him this high in terms of predicted salary.","According to the model, Davis is overpaid because he signed a huge extension in 2015 because of his unbelievable potential. In his short career, he has put up phenomenal scoring and rebounding numbers with a great free throw percentage.","According to the model, Paul is overpaid because he resigned with the Clippers in 2013 while he was almost undoubtedly the best PG in the NBA. He has been a great passer his whole career with decent scoring numbers as well.","According to the model, Randolph is underpaid because he signed an extension way back in 2011 while on the Memphis Grizzlies. The cap was only $58 million at the time. Randolph has been steady throughout his career as a solid rebounder and post scorer, but his injury woes have caused him to miss a lot of time.","According to the model, Lillard is overpaid because he signed a contract extension in 2015 as one of the league's brightest young stars. His incredible scoring and chemistry with CJ McCollum has allowed the Trail Blazers to have decent runs in the playoffs in years past.","According to the model, Durant is grossly overpaid because he signed the most controversial deal of the 2016 offseason - a 2 year, $53.4 million contract with the Warriors. Our model thinks that he is grossly overpaid which is interesting as there is not much to fault him for. If I had to guess, Durant's lowering point totals with Westbrook taking more shots caused the difference.","According to the model, Jordan is overpaid because he signed a large $88 million deal with the Clippers in 2015 because of his great rebounding and defensive skills. The battle between the Mavericks and Clippers for Jordan in 2015 led to his larger contract while his poor free throw shooting causes him to be overpaid.","According to the model, Gasol is overpaid because he also signed a big contract in 2015 while being a solid player each of his seasons with the Grizzlies.","According to the model, Thompson is slightly overpaid because of his large re-negotiation in 2015 caused his salary to jump from $3 million to $15.5 million. His phenomenal 3-point shooting and partnership with Steph Curry are the reasons for his big extension.","According to the model, Wall is overpaid because he, like Thompson, also signed a rookie contract extension in 2014 because of his great passing ability and leadership.","According to the model, Kevin Love is overpaid because he signed with the Cavaliers in 2015 for $113 million over 5 years when the salary cap increased. He was given this deal because of his fantastic rebounding and continued improvement as a 3-point shooter. ","According to the model, that Drummond is overpaid because he signed a max deal with the Pistons over the 2016 offseason.
